          <h2>Intent</h2>
          <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to make information conveyed by non-text content
             accessible through the use of a text alternative.  Text alternatives are a primary
             way for making information accessible because they can be rendered through any sensory
             modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) to match the needs of the user.
             Providing text alternatives allows the information to be rendered in a variety of
             ways by a variety of user agents. For example, a person who cannot see a picture can
             have the text alternative read aloud using synthesized speech. A person who cannot
             hear an audio file can have the text alternative displayed so that he or she can read
             it. In the future, text alternatives will also allow information to be more easily
             translated into sign language or into a simpler form of the same language.

                Note on CAPTCHA
                
                
             </h3>
             
             
             <p>
                CAPTCHAs are a controversial topic in the accessibility community. As is described
                in the
                paper 
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/">Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA</a>, CAPTCHAs intrinsically push the edges of human abilities in an attempt to defeat
                automated processes. Every type of CAPTCHA will be unsolvable by users with certain
                disabilities. However, they are widely used, and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
                Working Group believes that if CAPTCHAs were forbidden outright, Web sites would choose
                not to conform to WCAG rather than abandon CAPTCHA. This would create barriers for
                a great many more users with disabilities. For this reason the Working Group has chosen
                to structure the requirement about CAPTCHA in a way that meets the needs of most people
                with disabilities, yet is also considered adoptable by sites. Requiring two different
                forms of CAPTCHA on a given site ensures that most people with disabilities will find
                a form they can use.
                
             </p>
             
             
             <p>Because some users with disabilities will still not be able to access sites that meet
                the minimum requirements, the Working Group provides recommendations for additional
                steps. Organizations motivated to conform to WCAG should be aware of the importance
                of this topic and should go as far beyond the minimum requirements of the guidelines
                as possible. Additional recommended steps include:

                is made accessible through 
                <a href="time-based-media">1.2: Time-Based Media</a>.  However, it is important that users know what it is when they encounter it on a
                page so they can decide what action if any they want to take with it.  A text alternative
                that describes the time-based media and/or gives its title is therefore provided.

                   For Live Audio-only and live video-only content
                   </strong>, it can be much more difficult to provide text alternatives that provide equivalent
                information as live audio-only and live video-only content. For these types of non-text
                content, text alternatives provide a descriptive label.

                   Sometimes a test or exercise must be partially or completely presented in non-text
                   format.
                   </strong>  Audio or visual information is provided that cannot be changed to text because the
                test or exercise must be conducted using that sense.  For example, a hearing test
                would be invalid if a text alternative were provided.  A visual skill development
                exercise would similarly make no sense in text form.  And a spelling test with text
                alternatives would not be very effective.  For these cases, text alternatives should
                be provided to describe the purpose of the non-text content; of course, the text alternatives
                would not provide the same information needed to pass the test.

                   Sometimes content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience
                   </strong> that words cannot fully capture. Examples include a symphony performance, works of
                visual art etc. For such content, text alternatives at least identify the non-text
                content with a descriptive label and where possible, additional descriptive text.
                If the reason for including the content in the page is known and can be described
                it is helpful to include that information.

                <strong>Sometimes there are non-text exercises that are used to prove you are human.</strong> To avoid spam robots and other software from gaining access to a site a device called
                a CAPTCHA is used. These usually involve visual or auditory tasks that are beyond
                the current capabilities of Web robots. Providing a text alternative to them would
                however make them operable by Robots, thus defeating their purpose. In this case a
                text alternative would describe the purpose of the CAPTCHA, and alternate forms using
                different modalities would be provided to address the needs of people with different
                disabilities.

                   Sometimes there is non-text content that really is not meant to be seen or understood
                   by the user.
                   </strong> Transparent images used to move text over on a page; an invisible image that is used
                to track usage statistics; and a swirl in the corner that conveys no information but
                just fills up a blank space to create an aesthetic effect are all examples of this.
                Putting alternative text on such items just distracts people using screen readers
                from the content on the page. Not marking the content in any way, though, leaves users
                guessing what the non-text content is and what information they may have missed (even
                though they have not missed anything in reality). This type of non-text content, therefore,
                is marked or implemented in a way that assistive technologies (AT) will ignore it
                and not present anything to the user.
