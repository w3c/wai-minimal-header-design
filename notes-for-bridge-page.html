      <td>Reference to QuickRef</td>
      <td>Added link to QuickRef to Introduction, so that it is very prominent. Removed full explanation of how it works, as it is useful, but not an explanation of “The Documents”,  this page may not be the right time and place.</td>

      <td>Getting from one document to another section, including information on what links where, link to List of All Techniques, etc</td>
      <td>Removed: in the redesigned pages, existing links are made more obvious, missing ones (like to All Techniques) are embedded in the navigation. If we get this right, we can “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show,_don%27t_tell">show don't tell</a>”.</td>
